# ATLS4519-Final
Final Project Repo for ATLS4519 

HomePage.html and EducationPage.html are the files where we recoded certain components of the ascendingperformingarts.org site. The first file is the home page and the second file is the education page. When looking through the html code itself, we have commented within the code where each redesigned component is (for example: "< !--1st component: ....-- >").
